1. When asked to suggest new actions, add new/updated/completed suggestions/TODOs to `docs/PLAN.md`
2. Put/Find all your "tool scripts" in the `tools` folder.
3. Put/Find all test related files in the `tests` folder.
4. Put/Find all chat summaries in the `chat` folder.  `chat_<summary_title>_<datetime>.md`
5. To run PHP, use the full path: `C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.10-Win32-vs16-x64\php.exe`
6. Always use absolute paths to refer to files in tool calls!
Use: `C:\laragon\www\projects\currencyhub\tradedesk\v8` as base for files in the project. Don't `cd` to the current directory in the terminal! Avoid: `"C:\laragon\www\projects\currencyhub\tradedesk\v8" && C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.10-Win32-vs16-x64\php.exe -l js/app.js` - It always throws: "The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator"!
Instead use: `C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.10-Win32-vs16-x64\php.exe -l "C:\laragon\www\projects\currencyhub\tradedesk\v8\js\app.js"`
7. Migrations files must return a callable function!
