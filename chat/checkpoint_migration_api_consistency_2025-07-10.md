# Checkpoint: Migration & API Consistency Achieved
**Date:** 10 July 2025

## Summary
- Cleaned up all redundant/patch migrations; only one migration now manages each column.
- Fixed migration runner path issues; migrations are now found and executed correctly.
- Updated API to always return valid JSON, even on error, preventing frontend JSON parse errors.
- Converted all migrations to function-based format for consistency.
- Confirmed that migrations run successfully from the UI, with clear error reporting.

## Current State
- Database schema is correct and up-to-date.
- Migration system is robust and predictable.
- API and frontend error handling is user-friendly and reliable.

## Next Steps
- Test model classes and batch/trade logic now that the schema is correct.
- Implement async batch processing (Milestone 2.2).
- Add batch state management and progress tracking (Milestones 2.3, 3.3).
- Build or enhance batch detail UI components (Milestone 4.3).
- Integrate with trade execution or external APIs as needed.
