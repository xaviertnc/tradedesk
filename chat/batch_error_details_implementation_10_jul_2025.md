# Batch Error Details Implementation
**Date:** 10 July 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive batch error details functionality for the FX Batch Trader system, completing Milestone 3.3.3 and providing detailed error analysis and reporting capabilities.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Backend: Error Analysis Engine
- **`BatchService::getBatchErrors()`** - New method for comprehensive error analysis
  - Retrieves all failed trades for a specific batch
  - Groups errors by error type/message for pattern analysis
  - Provides detailed trade information for each failed trade
  - Returns structured error summary with counts and trade details

- **Error Grouping Logic**: Intelligent grouping of similar errors
  - Groups by `status_message` field
  - Provides count of each error type
  - Maintains list of affected trades for each error type
  - Enables pattern recognition and troubleshooting

### 2. API: Error Details Endpoint
- **`handleGetBatchErrors()`** - New API endpoint for error retrieval
- **`GET /api.php?action=get_batch_errors&id={batchId}`** - RESTful endpoint
- **Structured Response**: Returns comprehensive error data
  - Batch summary information
  - List of all failed trades with details
  - Error summary grouped by type
  - Total failed count for quick reference

### 3. Frontend: Error Viewing Interface
- **"View Errors" Button** - Added to batch detail modal
- **`viewBatchErrors()` JavaScript function** - Handles error data display
- **Error Summary Display**: Shows grouped errors with trade details
- **User-friendly Format**: Formatted error messages with client and amount information

### 4. Error Data Structure
- **Batch Context**: Includes batch UID and summary statistics
- **Failed Trades**: Complete list with client, amount, and error details
- **Error Summary**: Grouped by error type with counts and affected trades
- **Trade Details**: Client name, CIF, amount, and creation timestamp

## Files Modified
- **`BatchService.php`** - Added getBatchErrors method with error grouping logic
- **`api.php`** - Added handleGetBatchErrors endpoint handler
- **`index.html`** - Added "View Errors" button to batch detail modal
- **`js/app.js`** - Added viewBatchErrors function and event handler
- **`docs/TODO.md`** - Updated completed tasks (3.3.3)

## Technical Details
- **Error Grouping**: Groups by status_message for pattern analysis
- **Data Aggregation**: Provides both detailed and summary views
- **Error Classification**: Enables identification of common failure patterns
- **Trade Context**: Maintains full trade information for troubleshooting
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with existing batch management system

## Current State
- ✅ Batch error details can be retrieved via API
- ✅ Errors are intelligently grouped by type
- ✅ Error summary shows patterns and affected trades
- ✅ Frontend provides easy access to error information
- ✅ Error data includes full trade context for troubleshooting
- ✅ Integration with existing batch detail modal

## Next Steps

- **Milestone 5.1** - Integrate with actual Capitec APIs
- **Milestone 5.3** - Implement batch decision workflow
- **Milestone 5.4** - Add batch persistence and recovery

## Notes
- All changes follow established code style (2 spaces, proper spacing, doc headers)
- Error grouping enables quick identification of common issues
- Error data structure supports future analytics and reporting
- Integration with batch detail modal provides seamless user experience
- Foundation is complete for advanced error handling and recovery features
