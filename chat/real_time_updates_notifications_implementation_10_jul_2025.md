# Real-Time Updates & Notifications Implementation
**Date:** 10 July 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive real-time updates and notifications system for the FX Batch Trader, providing live WebSocket connectivity, automatic batch completion notifications, and enhanced user experience with visual feedback.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. WebSocket Real-Time Updates (Milestone 4.4.1)
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Implemented `GET /api/websocket` endpoint for real-time updates
- **Connection Management**: Automatic connection handling with reconnection logic
- **Heartbeat System**: 30-second heartbeat to maintain connection health
- **Update Broadcasting**: Real-time batch and trade status updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and connection recovery

### 2. Batch Completion Notifications (Milestone 4.4.3)
- **Notification Database**: Created `batch_notifications` table for persistent notifications
- **Notification Types**: Support for completion, started, cancelled, and status_change events
- **Automatic Triggers**: Notifications sent automatically on batch status changes
- **Notification Persistence**: Store notifications in database for reliability
- **Notification Retrieval**: API endpoints for pending notifications

### 3. Enhanced Batch Search & Filtering (Milestone 3.4)
- **Advanced Search API**: `GET /api/search_batches` with comprehensive filtering
- **Status Filtering**: Filter batches by status (pending, running, success, etc.)
- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter by creation date range
- **Pagination Support**: Configurable page size and offset
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date, status, trade counts, and other fields
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### 4. Frontend WebSocket Integration

- **Live Status Updates**: Real-time status indicators with visual feedback
- **WebSocket Status Indicator**: Connection status displayed in bottom-right corner
- **Enhanced Batch Cards**: Improved batch display with real-time updates
- **Update Animations**: Smooth animations for status changes and progress updates

### 7. Backend Notification Integration
- **BatchService Enhancements**: Added notification methods to BatchService
- **Automatic Triggers**: Notifications sent on batch start, completion, cancellation
- **Status Change Detection**: Automatic detection of significant status changes
- **Notification Storage**: Persistent storage of notifications in database
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with existing batch processing flow
