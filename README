# FX Execution API Test SPA

MyHubFx is a SPA app to test buying FX via API from Capitec bank.

API documentation is provided by the bank.

## Database Schema & Migrations

### Schema Validation

The application includes robust database schema validation to ensure data integrity:

- **Front-end validation**: The Settings page automatically verifies schema integrity when loaded
- **Back-end validation**: API endpoint `?action=verify_schema` returns detailed schema status
- **CLI validation**: Use `php verify-schema.php` for command-line schema checks

### Migration System

The application uses a migration system to manage database schema changes:

1. **Migration files** are stored in the `migrations/` directory
2. **Migration tracking** is handled by the `migrations` table
3. **Front-end interface** allows running migrations from the Settings page
4. **CLI support** for automated migration execution

### Database Repair

If schema issues are detected, several repair options are available:

#### Automatic Repair
```bash
php repair-database.php
```
This script will:
- Create missing tables
- Add missing columns  
- Run pending migrations
- Verify the final schema

#### Manual Repair
1. **Delete and recreate**: Remove `fx_trader.db` to let the app recreate it
2. **Run specific migrations**: Use the Settings page or CLI to run specific migrations
3. **Manual SQL**: Execute SQL commands directly on the database

### Schema Verification Tools

#### CLI Verification
```bash
# Check schema integrity
php verify-schema.php

# Run unit tests
php tests/SchemaVerificationTest.php
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET ?action=verify_schema` - Returns schema validation status
- `GET ?action=get_migrations` - Lists available and ran migrations
- `POST ?action=run_migration` - Executes a specific migration

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Schema is up to date" but runtime errors occur**
   - The database may have missing columns despite migrations being marked as "ran"
   - Run `php verify-schema.php` to check actual schema state
   - Use `php repair-database.php` to fix inconsistencies

2. **Migration fails with "already ran" error**
   - Check the `migrations` table for the migration record
   - If the migration didn't complete properly, manually delete the record and re-run

3. **Missing tables or columns after deployment**
   - Ensure all migration files are present in the `migrations/` directory
   - Run `php repair-database.php` to fix any missing schema elements

#### Schema Validation Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "is_valid": false,
  "errors": {
    "missing_tables": ["trades"],
    "missing_columns": {
      "clients": ["zar_account"],
      "trades": ["batch_id", "quote_id"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create migrations** for schema changes
2. **Test migrations** using the CLI tools
3. **Deploy migrations** through the front-end or CLI
4. **Verify schema** after deployment
5. **Monitor for issues** using the validation tools

### CI/CD Integration

For automated deployments, include schema validation in your pipeline:

```bash
# Pre-deployment check
php verify-schema.php

# Post-deployment verification  
php tests/SchemaVerificationTest.php
```

Exit codes:
- `0` = Schema is valid
- `1` = Schema has issues (requires repair)
